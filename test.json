They block my family cars in. I've been late to work because of this. On weekends, people even park there for their church services. One time, in the evening, there was a baseball game at the school, and two cars blocked my driveway and prevented me from going to the hospital when my mother got injured. Sometimes these drivers will stand around, and talk. I'll come out, and be like, \"What the fuck?\" They will get all tough, and threaten me. \n\nI've called the police several times, and they just come out, take a look at the cars, shrug, and give me advice like to put up a \"no parking sign\" or traffic cones. Done both. Doesn't deter these people. In fact someone stole my traffic cones at one point. \n\nWhat do I do now?
